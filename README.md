# WEB102 Prework - Sea Monster Crowdfunding

Submitted by: **Ryan Daniel LeKuch**

**Sea Monster Crowdfunding** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [ ] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [ ] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [ ] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.
* [ ] The website also contains statistics about the total number of games present on the website.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

* [ ] The application displays the most unfunded game, that requires more funding.

* [ ] Further, the information section contains perfect grammar that automatically updates as more games are added or removed from the website.

* [ ] Lastly, the most major feature that I added to this application was a search bar bonus feature. This allows you to type out any game and the website will immediately update the list of games present.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Most of the major challenges that were encountered while building the application were those revolving around JavaScript phrases. For example, at first I didn't understand how filters or reducing worked, and it took me a little bit of time.

Further, adding the extra challenge of the search bar also took me a bit of time to figure out. For example, the input type of text for the search bar as well as the 'input' event listener took me a little bit of research and time to get used to. Other than that, I really enjoyed building this application and learning all about REACT and JavaScript and how they interact. I really enjoyed this prework and am excited to learn more!
